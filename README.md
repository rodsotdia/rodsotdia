> When I’m not at work, I experiment with photography and mixed media, exploring personal reflections and life itself, often focusing on questions rather than answers. It’s been a privilege to share my work in group exhibitions across Argentina, Vietnam, the U.S., New Zealand, and Chile, and to see it featured in a few publications along the way.

> If you’re working on something that blends creativity and code (big or small), I'm always open to collaborating to create something together.
