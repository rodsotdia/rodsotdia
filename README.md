✦ Creative Web Developer \
✦ Digital Designer \
✦ Visual Crafter

> I’ve spent over a decade working at the intersection of design and web development, bridging creativity and code, whether designing thoughtful digital experiences or bringing them to life through development.
>
> When I’m not at work, I experiment with photography and mixed media, exploring personal reflections and life itself, often focusing on questions rather than answers. It’s been a privilege to share my work in group exhibitions across Argentina, Vietnam, the U.S., New Zealand, and Chile, and to see it featured in a few publications along the way.
>
> If you’re working on something that blends creativity and code (big or small), I'm open to collaborating and creating something together!
